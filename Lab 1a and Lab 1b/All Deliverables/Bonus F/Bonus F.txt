## Bonus-F CloudWatch Logs Insights Query Pack

Two important notes:
- CloudWatch Logs Insights works only on logs in CloudWatch Logs.
- This pack covers WAF logs (when `waf_log_destination = "cloudwatch"`) and app logs (`/aws/ec2/<project>-rds-app`).

ALB access logs are in S3, not CloudWatch Logs (unless you ship them to CW via another pipeline).
For ALB, correlate via CloudWatch metrics (5xx alarm + metrics) and optionally Athena later.

### Variables students fill in
- WAF log group: `aws-waf-logs-chrisbarm-webacl01`
- App log group: `/aws/ec2/chrisbarm-rds-app`

Requirement: set time range to Last 15 minutes (or match incident window).

## A) WAF Queries (CloudWatch Logs Insights)

### A1) What is happening right now? (Top actions: ALLOW/BLOCK)
```sql
fields @timestamp, action
| stats count() as hits by action
| sort hits desc
```

### A2) Top client IPs (who is hitting us the most?)
```sql
fields @timestamp, httpRequest.clientIp as clientIp
| stats count() as hits by clientIp
| sort hits desc
| limit 25
```

### A3) Top requested URIs (what are they trying to reach?)
```sql
fields @timestamp, httpRequest.uri as uri
| stats count() as hits by uri
| sort hits desc
| limit 25
```

### A4) Blocked requests only (who/what is being blocked?)
```sql
fields @timestamp, action, httpRequest.clientIp as clientIp, httpRequest.uri as uri
| filter action = "BLOCK"
| stats count() as blocks by clientIp, uri
| sort blocks desc
| limit 25
```

### A5) Which WAF rule is doing the blocking?
```sql
fields @timestamp, action, terminatingRuleId, terminatingRuleType
| filter action = "BLOCK"
| stats count() as blocks by terminatingRuleId, terminatingRuleType
| sort blocks desc
| limit 25
```

### A6) Rate of blocks over time (did it spike?)
```sql
fields @timestamp, httpRequest.clientIp as clientIp, httpRequest.uri as uri
| filter uri like /wp-login|xmlrpc|\.env|admin|phpmyadmin|\.git|\/login/i
| stats count() as hits by clientIp, uri
| sort hits desc
| limit 50
```

### A7) Suspicious scanners (common patterns: admin paths, wp-login, etc.)
```sql
fields @timestamp, httpRequest.clientIp as clientIp, httpRequest.uri as uri
| filter uri like /wp-login|xmlrpc|\.env|admin|phpmyadmin|\.git|\/login/i
| stats count() as hits by clientIp, uri
| sort hits desc
| limit 50
```

### A8) Country/geo (if present in your WAF logs)
```sql
fields @timestamp, httpRequest.country as country
| stats count() as hits by country
| sort hits desc
| limit 25
```

## B) App Queries (EC2 app log group)
These assume your app logs include strings like ERROR, DBConnectionErrors, timeout, etc.

### B1) Count errors over time (align with alarm window)
```sql
fields @timestamp, @message
| filter @message like /ERROR|Exception|Traceback|DB|timeout|refused/i
| stats count() as errors by bin(1m)
| sort bin(1m) asc
```

### B2) Show the most recent DB failures (triage view)
```sql
fields @timestamp, @message
| filter @message like /DB|mysql|timeout|refused|Access denied|could not connect/i
| sort @timestamp desc
| limit 50
```

### B3) Is it creds or network? classifier hints
```sql
fields @timestamp, @message
| filter @message like /Access denied|authentication failed|timeout|refused|no route|could not connect/i
| stats count() as hits by
	case(
		@message like /Access denied|authentication failed/i, "Creds/Auth",
		@message like /timeout|no route/i, "Network/Route",
		@message like /refused/i, "Port/SG/ServiceRefused",
		"Other"
	)
| sort hits desc
```

### B4) Extract structured fields (requires JSON logs)
```sql
fields @timestamp, level, event, reason
| filter level = "ERROR"
| stats count() as n by event, reason
| sort n desc
```

## C) Correlation mini-workflow (runbook section)

Step 1 — Confirm signal timing
- CloudWatch alarm time window: last 5-15 minutes
- Run App B1 to see error spike time bins

Step 2 — Decide: attack vs backend failure
- Run WAF A1 + A6
- If BLOCK spikes align with incident time: likely external pressure/scanning
- If WAF is quiet but app errors spike: likely backend (RDS/SG/creds)

Step 3 — If backend failure suspected
- Run App B2 and classify:
	- Access denied: secrets drift or wrong password
	- timeout: SG/routing/RDS down
- Retrieve known-good values:
	- Parameter Store /lab/db/*
	- Secrets Manager /<prefix>/rds/mysql

Step 4 — Verify recovery
- App errors return to baseline (B1)
- WAF blocks stabilize (A6)
- Alarm returns to OK
