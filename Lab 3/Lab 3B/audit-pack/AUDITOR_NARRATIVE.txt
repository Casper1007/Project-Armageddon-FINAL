DELIVERABLE B — AUDITOR NARRATIVE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

This infrastructure design satisfies APPI (Act on the Protection of Personal 
Information) data residency requirements through a "compute travels, data stays" 
architecture. All Personal Health Information (PHI) resides exclusively in Tokyo 
 (ap-northeast-1) with zero database replication to any other AWS region, as 
evidenced by RDS deployment verification showing chrisbarm-rds01 in Tokyo and 
zero instances in São Paulo or elsewhere. The São Paulo region (sa-east-1) 
provides compute-only services with a controlled Transit Gateway corridor; TGW 
peering and static routes prove cross-region compute access while PHI remains 
anchored in Japan. CloudFront with WAF at the edge provides global low-latency 
access while protecting origin infrastructure, and all audit logs (CloudTrail, 
VPC Flow Logs, CloudFront logs) are centralized in Tokyo S3 buckets with 7-year 
retention and S3 versioning for immutability. We cannot store PHI outside Japan 
because APPI mandates that sensitive personal data processed by Japanese entities 
must remain within national jurisdiction unless explicit consent is obtained, and 
healthcare data carries heightened protection requirements that make cross-border 
storage non-compliant—our architecture demonstrates compliance by showing that 
databases exist only in Tokyo, compute resources will access data via controlled 
TGW routes without replication, and comprehensive audit trails provide regulators 
with cryptographically-validated evidence of "who changed what, when" for the 
required retention period.

Security validation includes periodic penetration testing to confirm that the 
edge controls (CloudFront/WAF) cannot be bypassed and that the origin remains 
protected under adversarial conditions.
