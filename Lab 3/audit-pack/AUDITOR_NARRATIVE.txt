DELIVERABLE B — AUDITOR NARRATIVE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

This infrastructure design satisfies APPI (Act on the Protection of Personal 
Information) data residency requirements through a "compute travels, data stays" 
architecture. All Personal Health Information (PHI) resides exclusively in Tokyo 
(ap-northeast-1) with zero database replication to any other AWS region, as 
evidenced by RDS deployment verification showing chrisbarm-rds01 in Tokyo and 
zero instances in São Paulo or elsewhere. The São Paulo region (sa-east-1) 
provides compute-only services via a controlled Transit Gateway peering corridor, 
enabling application processing without data transfer—network routes explicitly 
prove that only compute requests traverse regions while PHI remains anchored in 
Japan. CloudFront with WAF at the edge provides global low-latency access while 
protecting origin infrastructure, and all audit logs (CloudTrail, VPC Flow Logs, 
CloudFront logs) are centralized in Tokyo S3 buckets with 7-year retention and 
S3 versioning for immutability. We cannot store PHI outside Japan because APPI 
mandates that sensitive personal data processed by Japanese entities must remain 
within national jurisdiction unless explicit consent is obtained, and healthcare 
data carries heightened protection requirements that make cross-border storage 
non-compliant—our architecture proves compliance by demonstrating that databases 
exist only in Tokyo, compute resources access data via controlled TGW routes 
without replication, and comprehensive audit trails provide regulators with 
cryptographically-validated evidence of "who changed what, when" for the required 
retention period.
