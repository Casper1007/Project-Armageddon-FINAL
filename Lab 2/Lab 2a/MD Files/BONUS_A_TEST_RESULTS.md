## Detailed Results

### ‚úÖ Test 1: EC2 is Private (15 points)
```
Instance ID: i-08070fd0a79861017
PublicIpAddress: null
Result: ‚úì PASS
```
**Finding:** EC2 instance successfully deployed with no public IP.

---

### ‚úÖ Test 2: VPC Endpoints Exist (20 points)
```
Endpoints found:
‚úì com.amazonaws.us-east-1.ssm
‚úì com.amazonaws.us-east-1.ec2messages
‚úì com.amazonaws.us-east-1.ssmmessages
‚úì com.amazonaws.us-east-1.logs
‚úì com.amazonaws.us-east-1.secretsmanager
‚úì com.amazonaws.us-east-1.kms
‚úì com.amazonaws.us-east-1.s3

Result: ‚úì PASS (7/7 endpoints)
```
**Finding:** All required VPC Interface Endpoints successfully created.

---

### ‚è≥ Test 3: Session Manager Registration (20 points)
**Status:** In Progress - SSM Agent Registering  
**Timeline:** Instances take 2-3 minutes after launch for SSM agent to register  
**What's Happening:** EC2 is booting and connecting to SSM service via endpoints  
**Next Step:** Re-run test in 2-3 minutes - should show instance ID in managed instances  

**Command to re-test:**
```bash
aws ssm describe-instance-information --region us-east-1 --query "InstanceInformationList[].InstanceId"
# Expected: i-08070fd0a79861017
```

---

### ‚è≥ Test 4: Config Store Access (20 points)
**Status:** Manual Verification Required  
**Instructions:**
```bash
# 1. Once SSM agent registers, open session:
aws ssm start-session --target i-08070fd0a79861017 --region us-east-1

# 2. Inside session, run shell:
sh

# 3. Inside shell, run test 4:
bash verify_bonus_a_4_config_stores.sh /lab/db/endpoint lab1a/rds/mysql us-east-1

# Expected output:
# Test 1: Retrieving parameter from SSM Parameter Store...
#   ‚úì Parameter retrieved: <value>
# Test 2: Retrieving secret from Secrets Manager...
#   ‚úì Secret retrieved (contains valid credentials)
# ‚úì PASS: EC2 can access both Parameter Store and Secrets Manager
```

---

### ‚è≥ Test 5: CloudWatch Logs Endpoint (15 points)
**Status:** Pending Endpoint Connectivity  
**Log Group:** `/aws/ec2/bonus-a-rds-app`  
**Log Group Status:** Created ‚úì  
**Test pending:** Write capability test requires endpoint verification  

**Command to check:**
```bash
bash verify_bonus_a_5_cloudwatch_logs.sh "/aws/ec2/bonus-a-rds-app" us-east-1

# Expected:
# Test 1: Log group exists ‚úì
# Test 2: Log streams available ‚Ñπ
# Test 3: Can write test event ‚úì
```

## Infrastructure Deployment Status

‚úÖ **Successfully Deployed:**
- Bonus-A EC2 instance (i-08070fd0a79861017)
- 7 VPC Interface Endpoints (SSM, EC2Msg, SSMMsg, Logs, Secrets, KMS, S3)
- IAM role with least-privilege policies
- Security groups (3 layers)
- CloudWatch log group
- RDS connectivity rule

‚úÖ **Verified:**
- Private IP configuration
- VPC endpoint creation
- IAM role attachment
- Log group creation

‚è≥ **In Progress:**
- SSM agent registration
- Session Manager connectivity
- Config store access
- CloudWatch logs write test

---

## Next Steps (To Complete All Tests)

1. **Wait for SSM Agent (Expected: 2-3 minutes from now)**
   - Agent auto-registers with SSM service
   - Uses VPC endpoints for communication
   - No manual action needed

2. **Re-run Test 3 (in ~5 minutes)**
   ```bash
   bash verify_bonus_a_3_session_manager.sh i-08070fd0a79861017 us-east-1
   ```

3. **Once Test 3 Passes, Run Test 4**
   ```bash
   # Open session
   aws ssm start-session --target i-08070fd0a79861017 --region us-east-1
   # Inside: bash verify_bonus_a_4_config_stores.sh
   ```

4. **Run Test 5 Independently**
   ```bash
   bash verify_bonus_a_5_cloudwatch_logs.sh "/aws/ec2/bonus-a-rds-app" us-east-1
   ```
