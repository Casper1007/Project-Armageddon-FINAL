Project Overview: The Big Picture

This project demonstrates a progressive security hardening journey from basic cloud architecture to enterprise-grade infrastructure. It's structured as 4 interconnected labs where each builds on previous layers:

Lab 1a: Foundation (EC2 ↔ RDS)
Lab 1b: Resilience (Observability + Incident Response)
Lab 2: Edge Security (CloudFront + WAF + Origin Cloaking)
Bonus-A: Hardening (Zero Internet Exposure + VPC Endpoints)

---

Each lab includes:
- WHAT was built (infrastructure, code, security)
- HOW it was implemented (Terraform, Python, Bash)
- WHY these decisions were made (security, compliance, real-world patterns)

See the markdown file for:
- Full code and Terraform patterns
- Security and architecture explanations
- Verification and automation details
- Interview-ready summary table and talking points
